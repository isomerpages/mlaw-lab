<p>Family lawyers and social service professionals often have the same clients
– it would be wonderful for them to join forces to help their mutual clients.
However, at both an individual and organisational level, it seems that
the two professions often do not mix or communicate with each other.</p>
<p>To break down barriers and build bridges between the two professions,
the Legal Aid Bureau (“LAB”) decided to hold a “mixer” for both family
lawyers and social service professionals. It was the first time LAB had
done something like this – and we think it might be the nation’s first
such mixer, since everyone we invited said they had never been to a similar
event!</p>
<p>The first session took place just yesterday, on 9 July 2024, in the afternoon.
It was attended by LAB’s partners, such as Monfort Care, the Ministry of
Social and Family Development, and representatives from various Family
Services Centres , as well as our own LAB lawyers, Assigned Solicitors
and other family lawyers.</p>
<p>The session began with presentations by our partners on such issues as
child protection, fostering, and services available to support children
and families in distress. This followed by a lively Q &amp; A session.
After the tea break was the afternoon’s highlight - two “speed-dating”
sessions. Participants sat in groups, comprising a mix of social service
professionals and lawyers. The room was filled with the buzz of conversation
and laughter, as everyone got to know each other better. At the close of
the session, participants shared that they enjoyed making new friends and
learning new things. There were also some interesting ideas on how both
professions could collaborate more closely in future – so watch this space!</p>
<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> of the two sessions will be held on 20 August 2024.</p>
