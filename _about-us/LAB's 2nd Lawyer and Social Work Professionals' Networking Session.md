<h4>Lawyer-Social Service Professional Mixer â€“ 2<sup>nd</sup> Run - it just gets better!</h4>

â€“ it would be wonderful for them to join forces to help their mutual clients.
However, at both an individual and organisational level, it seems that
the two professions often do not mix or communicate with each other. Hence
LAB organised our inaugural Lawyer-Social Service Professional Mixer, with
the first run taking place on 9 July 2024.</p>
<p>The first run was great fun! We then did a 2<sup>nd</sup> run on 20 August
2024 â€“ and had an even bigger turnout this time.</p>
<p>Like the first run, we started with presentations by our partners on issues
such as child protection, fostering, and services available to support
children and families in distress. This was followed by a lively Q &amp;
A session, and then a couple of rounds of speed dating, where lawyers and
social work professionals got to meet and chat with each other.</p>
<p>The room was filled with the buzz of conversation and laughter. Both professions
had exciting ideas on how they could collaborate more closely in future.
The common sentiment was that they would like to see more of these mixers
happening in future.</p>
<p>We shall regroup and take a breather first. ðŸ˜Š And thenâ€¦. we will heed
