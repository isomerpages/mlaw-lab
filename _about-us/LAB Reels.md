## LAB's Officers Through Their Children's Eyes
At work, our identities are “Legal Officers” and Legal Executives”. How do we explain our work identities to our children? Do our children see how hard we work, to support our Applicants?   
 
This video highlights the work done by LAB officers from the point of view of their children. 
 
Heartwarming and amusing - watch the video to find out more about what the children think their parents do!
