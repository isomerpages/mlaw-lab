<h3><strong>Introducing Section 6A - Supporting Volunteers for Mentally Incapacitated Persons</strong></h3>
<p>We are excited to share a significant update to the Legal Aid and Advice
Act ("LAAA") with the introduction of Section 6A! This amendment marks
a step forward in enhancing&nbsp;access to justice&nbsp;and empowering
professionals to step in when vulnerable individuals need assistance the
most.</p>
<p><strong>What's New?</strong>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAAA1995?ProvIds=P12-#pr6A-" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new Section 6A</a> ensures
volunteers (social workers, professional deputies) from means testing when
helping mentally incapacitated persons with legal aid. This applies when
the person qualifies and has no suitable family members as deputies, removing
financial barriers for volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;<strong>No financial barriers; streamlined access</strong>: Volunteers
can support vulnerable individuals without incurring additional legal costs.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Means test applies to the person lacking capacity</strong>:
Volunteers will not be subject to the usual means test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>How to apply?</strong>
</p>
<p>Volunteer deputies may send in their names, e-mail addresses and contact
numbers to <a href="mailto:labssr_mailbox@lab.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">labssr_mailbox@lab.gov.sg</a>
