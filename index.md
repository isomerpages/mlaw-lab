        - title: Waiver of Legal Aid Means Test Requirements for Volunteer Deputies w.e.f.
            1 April 2025
          date: 01 April 2025
          announcement: LAAA's new Section 6A ensures volunteers (social workers,
            professional deputies) from means testing when helping mentally
            incapacitated persons with legal aid. This applies when the person
            qualifies and has no suitable family members as deputies, removing
            financial barriers for volunteers.
