In view of the COV-19 situation, please use our e-services to minimize unnecessary visits to the Ministry of Law Services Centre.  If you are an existing applicant, you can send us an [online enquiry](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/enquiry/), make payments and upload your documents online at our [Portal](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/).<br>
If you donâ€™t have an application with LAB and are thinking of applying for legal aid, please consider whether your case is urgent (for example if you are a defendant in a court case, i.e. someone is suing you). If it can wait, you may wish to visit the Ministry of Law Services Centre at a later time. <br>
In line with the safe-distancing measures, we will limit the number of people entering the Ministry of Law Services Centre. Please come down alone. Exceptions will only be made for the elderly, those with special needs, and / or those who require assistance with mobility.
