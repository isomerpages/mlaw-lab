In view of the COV-19 situation, please use our e-services to minimize unnecessary visits to the Ministry of Law Services Centre.  If you are an existing applicant, you can send us an [online enquiry](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/enquiry/), make payments and upload your documents online at our [Portal](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/).<br>
If you donâ€™t have an application with LAB and are thinking of applying for legal aid, please consider whether your case is urgent (for example if you are a defendant in a court case, i.e. someone is suing you). If it can wait, you may wish to visit the Ministry of Law Services Centre at a later time. <br>
