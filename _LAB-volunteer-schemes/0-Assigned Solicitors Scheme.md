<b> <u>What is an Assigned Solicitor? </u> </b> <br>
An Assigned Solicitor is a private lawyer who has volunteered and been appointed by the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) to help in its work. A significant proportion of LAB's work is handled by Assigned Solicitors, who are a key pillar of the Legal Aid Scheme. <br>

<b> <u>What are the duties of an Assigned Solicitor? </u> </b> <br>
Assigned Solicitors assist LAB by:
* Giving opinions on whether legal aid should be granted for particular cases
* Giving legal advice to, and acting for, legally aided persons
* Sitting in Legal Aid Board meetings with the Director of Legal Aid in order to determine whether aid should be granted for particular cases. <br>

<b> <u>What qualifications are needed to apply to  be an Assigned Solicitor? </u> </b> <br>
You need to have a valid practising certificate in order to apply to be an Assigned Solicitor.

If you are a lawyer who wishes to volunteer but no longer have a valid practising certificate, you may apply to be a volunteer under the Volunteer Lawyers Scheme. You may similarly visit our e-services page and click on the link "Register as an LAB Volunteer" to sign up.  <br>
