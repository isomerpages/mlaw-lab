## Grant of Aid

The Legal Aid Board comprises the Director of Legal Aid and at least two independent solicitors who are on LAB's Panel of Assigned Solicitors.

If the Board is of the view that your case has merits, i.e. you have a reasonable case to bring or defend in court, then it will decide to grant you legal aid.

However, if the Board is of the view that your case does not have merits, i.e. you do not have a reasonable case to bring or defend in court, then it will decide not to grant you legal aid.

LAB will send you a letter letting you know whether you have been granted legal aid. If you have not been granted legal aid, then the letter will briefly explain the reasons for this. 

With effect from 16 October 2019, the Director for Legal Aid can, without reference to the Legal Aid Board, approve applications for legal aid in certain types of cases e.g. uncontested adoption proceedings, simple uncontested divorce proceedings, non-disputed proceedings for grant of letters of administration or probate. <br>
*Do note that you will still have to pass the Means Test and show that you have a meritorious case for aid to be granted. 

All decisions of the Legal Aid Board and/or the Director of Legal Aid in respect of applications for legal aid are final.

*For the full list of prescribed classes of proceedings, you may refer to the 2nd Schedule to the [Legal Aid and Advice Regulations](/files/LAAR-Amended.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
