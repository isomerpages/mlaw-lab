## How do I pay my contribution or other charges to LAB?

You can make payment through the following methods:

1. Pay online at [https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/){:target="_blank"}. Select “For Applicant” and log in to the ePortal using your Singpass. Click on “Check My Payment”.

2. Send a cheque or money order for the amount to us. All cheques or money orders should be **crossed** and made payable to the **Director of Legal Aid**. Please ensure that your name, NRIC and case reference number are written on the reverse of the cheque or money order.  Please do not send cash by post.

**Please note that with effect from 7 April 2020, MinLaw Services Centre will no longer accept cash payments. Alternatively, you can make all payments online via LAB's e-services portal and we encourage you to do so.**
