## Casino Exclusion

If you are granted legal aid, you will be subject to Third-Party Casino Exclusion. 

This means that you will not be allowed to enter, remain, or take part in any gaming on any casino premises.

No further action is necessary on your part as the Bureau will be liasing with the National Council on Problem Gambling on this.
