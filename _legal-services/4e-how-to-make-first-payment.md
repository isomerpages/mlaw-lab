How do I pay my contribution or other charges to LAB?
---

You can make payment through the following methods:

1. Come down in person to LAB to pay using either **Cash or Nets**. You will not need to take a Queue Number for making payment.

2. Send a cheque or money order for the amount to us. All cheques or money orders should be **crossed** and made payable to the **Director of Legal Aid**. Please ensure that your name, NRIC and case reference number are written on the reverse of the cheque or money order.  Please do not send cash by post.

3. Pay online at [https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/){:target="_blank"}. Select “For Applicant” and log in to the ePortal using your Singpass. Click on “Check My Payment”.

4. Please note that with effect from 7 April 2020, MinLaw Customer Service Centre will no longer accept cash payments and only payments by NETS can be made at our Self Service Payment Kiosks. <br> Please make any payment online via our e-services portal where possible.
