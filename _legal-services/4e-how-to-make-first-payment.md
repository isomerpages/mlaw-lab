How do I pay my contribution or other charges to LAB?
---

You can make payment through the following methods:

1. Come down in person to the Minlaw Services Centre to pay by **Nets**. You do not need to take a queue number to make payment.

2. Send a cheque or money order for the amount to us. All cheques or money orders should be **crossed** and made payable to the **Director of Legal Aid**. Please ensure that your name, NRIC and case reference number are written on the reverse of the cheque or money order.  Please do not send cash by post.

3. Pay online at [https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/labesvc/){:target="_blank"}. Select “For Applicant” and log in to the ePortal using your Singpass. Click on “Check My Payment”.

4. **Please note that with effect from 7 April 2020, MinLaw Services Centre will no longer accept cash payments. All payments are strictly by NETS. Alternatively, you can make all payments online via LAB's e-services portal.**
