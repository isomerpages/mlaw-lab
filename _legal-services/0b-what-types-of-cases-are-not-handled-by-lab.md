## What types of cases are not handled by LAB?

**Criminal Proceedings**<br>

LAB does not handle criminal proceedings.

If you require legal advice or representation in criminal proceedings, you may approach the Law Society Pro Bono Services (Singapore) which administers the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme ("CLAS").

You can find out more about CLAS at [http://www.lawsocprobono.org/Pages/Criminal-Legal-Aid-Scheme.aspx](http://www.lawsocprobono.org/Pages/Criminal-Legal-Aid-Scheme.aspx){:target="_blank"} and CLAS can be contacted at 6534 1564.

**Certain Civil Proceedings**<br>

LAB also does not handle certain civil proceedings including, but not limited to, the following:

* Defamation cases
* Proceedings before the Small Claims Tribunal and the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents
* Mediation at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management and proceedings before the Employment Claims Tribunal

Generally, LAB also does not handle proceedings in the Family Court for Maintenance and Personal Protection Orders where the opposing party is not legally represented, unless there are exceptional circumstances, for example the applicant is a vulnerable person (e.g. disabled, bedridden)

**Proceedings involving Foreign Law or Foreign Subject Matter**<br>

LAB is only authorised to give legal advice on Singapore law, and to provide aid for civil proceedings in the Singapore courts. Is is therefore unlikely to be able to assist in cases clearly involving foreign law or a foreign subject matter e.g. property outside of Singapore.
