* Adoption
* Custody of children
* Monetary claims
* Appointment of a Deputy under the Mental Capacity Act
* Claims in tort, e.g. compensation for injuries from accidents or medical negligence
* Estate matters<br>
(including the application for a Grant of Letters of Administration or Probate, which are documents authorising the personal representative(s) of a deceased person to deal with and distribute the deceased person's assets)
